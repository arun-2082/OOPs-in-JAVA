# OOPs-in-JAVA
The concept of object-oriented programming (OOPs) is based on the ideas of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It enables users to make the kinds of objects they desire and the methods to handle them. Creating objects, reusing them throughout the programme, and manipulating these things to get results is the fundamental idea of OOPs.

"Object Oriented Programming," as the term is often known and utilised, is a key idea in contemporary programming languages like Java.
