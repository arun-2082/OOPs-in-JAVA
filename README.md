Data abstraction is the process of withholding certain information from the user and only displaying what is absolutely necessary.
Abstract classes or interfaces can be used to accomplish abstraction (which you will learn more about in the next chapter).

A non-access modifier for classes and methods is the term abstract:

A limited class called an abstract cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).

Only applicable in an abstract class, an abstract method lacks a body. The subclass provides the body (inherited from).
